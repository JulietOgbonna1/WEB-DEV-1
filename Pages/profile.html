    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> My name is Ogbonna Juliet Ngozi. Iâ€™m deeply passionate about business, tech, creativity, and growth. I run a hairstyling brand and also recently kickstarted a food delivery business. <br>Currently, Iâ€™m diving into the world of web development, while also sharpening my skills in graphic design.
    Learning new things, exploring opportunities in tech, and building long-term wealth drive me every day. I believe in staying curious, consistent, and committed to the journey. The best is yet to come! ðŸš€
</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I hail from Obukpa in Nsukka Local Government Area, Enugu State, Nigeria. I come from a humble background â€” raised in a low-income family where access to resources was limited, but the desire to dream big was limitless. Growing up, I witnessed firsthand the challenges of making ends meet, and from a young age, I knew I wanted to create a better future â€” not just for myself, but for those around me.
Despite the odds, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to technology. I was that curious child who wanted to know how things worked â€” from phones and computers to websites and apps. Even when I didnâ€™t have the tools, I made the most of every little opportunity â€” borrowing devices, reading books, watching free tutorials, asking questions, and teaching myself whatever I could.
<br>Presently, Iâ€™m actively learning web development and practicing graphic design, turning that early curiosity into real, valuable skills. Iâ€™m deeply passionate about tech, creativity, learning, and building wealth â€” not just financially, but in knowledge, impact, andÂ self-growth. <br>I believe my background isnâ€™t a limitation â€” itâ€™s the foundation of my hunger, resilience, and vision. Iâ€™m committed to using my journey to inspire, grow, and create a life that reflects everything Iâ€™ve worked for.
